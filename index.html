						<h1>Playstyle</h1>

						<p class="playstyle_description">
							Casper Ruud has a huge, disruptive forehand, with which he lands an average of 65 percent of his strikes, even if it means sometimes shifting his court positioning dangerously to the backhand side; and stamina not to be taken for granted, like this eye-opening exchange of 55 strokes at the end of the first set of his semi-final with Karen Khachanov. <br><br>

							Looking at the way in which Casper Ruud crafts points and how he strikes the ball, his game is ideal to be a clay court champion. His forehand is incredibly heavy, allowing him to work opponents all over the court, almost at will. At the same time, his backhand is solid, with Ruud throwing in very few unforced errors from this wing. On a clay court, he makes full use of these strengths too, hitting heavy from the back, and making the game very physical for his opponents. <br><br>

							Another element that has to be discussed for Casper Ruud’s playing style is his serve. Casper Ruud also has an effective first serve. Against Khachanov, when Ruud managed to play a forehand behind his first serve, Ruud hit the mark 82% of the time. Given that he isn’t the biggest guy out there, he does what most "not as tall"players do – he makes plenty of first serves and kicks his second. <br><br>

							Coming back to his serve, however, I want to point out how well he uses the kick serve. This serve is largely used in tennis as a way to hit a somewhat aggressive second serve. But Ruud uses it for his first serve at times, especially from the ad-court. He generates so much kick on the ball that he can open up the court with this one shot alone. Of course, he immediately looks for the forehand following such a serve. </p>
